# Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction App
This app predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on user-input pollutant concentrations like PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, and SO₂. It uses a trained machine learning model to estimate AQI levels and classifies air quality into categories ranging from "Good" to "Hazardous."
The app helps users understand air pollution levels and make informed decisions about outdoor activities and health precautions.
